Once upon a time.. (img)

<p> Bandwagon was created in the room far far away in the East of Singapore. 

By a boy who just loves live music and was always wondering who's coming to perform next and where else he could go to hear some new stuff. 

U'd probably spot him staring at the giant events calender at the Esplanade (picture), notoriously typing away on his iPhone. And nope, he wasn't texting the calender. 

Or maybe at a pub picking up whatever leaflets or upcoming music event postcards that were... aha..  free. :) 

"Won't it be cool if someone would actually pool ALLLLL this information together and put em up on the web in ONE place so the finding gets so much easier?", he thought.

"You bet that'd be cool," his angelic inner voice, always the positive preacher, shrieked in delight.

"Ahem, Problem is, who's gonna do it?" the devil, shaded in the dark corner bellowed in response. 

That's true. I mean, he knew nothing about creating a website. Afterall, all he's learnt were ($ % + -), nothing of.... < html > { CSS } and the likes. 

---------

Well two months on... that boy decided to take matters into his own hands. Ploughing into books on books... (picture) And what you see here today is the humble effort of one boy's dedication to finding a solution for something he thought would help him and hopefully others who love music.

It ain't perfect, but he's working on it. :) And hopefully some people out there would be interested to join him and make it better.  

So use it, share it, enjoy it, laugh at it, slam it, hate it, whatever u please. </p>
