Bandwagon is a live music gig finder. 
The aim of it is to connect people to live music. 

Users would be able to search out events fast by leveraging on the awesome Angular JS to search and filter. 
They would also be able to find out more about the artistes who are performing and the place, which would range from bars and pubs to concert halls. 

Current challenges in this commit include: 

1) Adding more detailed information about the places into the place details page as there already is one controller generating the events in that particular place.

2) Adding google maps that would indicate the location of the place. (Zip code and address is already stored in the PlacesDetailCtrl controller)

Thanks for having a look at this.
