7/10/2011	Sunday	Esplanade Recital Studio	The Tryst		1930	$24Concessions: for students, NSF and senior citizens: $16	Intimate encounters with four late 20th century composers at the disco, in a garden and on the road, all after violin and piano have taken a Scottish love poem and weaved their own tender embraces around it. Dutch composer Louis Andriessen says of his modern take on the dance hall, "Nothing goes smoothly any more", while, in characteristically mystic and misty vein, Japan's greatest 20th century composer declares "I would like to achieve a sound as intense as silence". For his part, John Adams describes his 1995 piece for violin and piano as beginning with "a relaxed drive down a not unfamiliar road" and ending with "a giddy, bouncy ride for four wheel drives only". It all sounds pretty frenetic but, again to quote Adams, "Relax, and let us do the driving!"
