3 Oct 11	Singapore Indoor Stadium	Westlife 	Pop 	2000	$80-$150	The quartet’s eleventh offering, Gravity, sees the Irishmen sail into uncharted waters, wrestle an unprecedented level of creative control and most critically of all – start believing in themselves again. “It’s a really good album,” insists Nicky Byrne. “It’s one producer. It’s one sound. Maybe it’s taken us twelve years to get there. But it doesn’t matter. We’re here now.  “It’s the kind of record we knew we could make and we just needed the right person to deliver it with us.”  And that individual was legendary producer John Shanks. He steered Take That’s last two collections, was responsible for Bon Jovi’s recent reinvention and sculpted some of Kelly Clarkson, Celine Dion and Sheryl Crow’s most enduring hits.	http://www.midaspromotions.com/upcoming.htm

21 Oct 11	Esplanade Concert Hall	Mahler's Seventh (Singapore Symphonic Orchestra)	Classical	1930	$15-$72	Sometimes referred to as the Song of the Night, Mahler’s Seventh is a work of contrasts. Begun in 1904 at Mahler’s lakeside retreat in the Carinthian mountains in a spirit of cheerfulness and optimism, the three years that followed before its premiere were to bring to the composer a series of personal tragedies – including the death of his daughter and the diagnosis of a terminal heart condition – such that the resulting work is an intriguing combination of melancholy and celebration. It has been described by one critic as “a vigorous life-asserting pageant of Mahlerian blatancy”. 	http://www.sistic.com.sg/portal/dt?dt.isPortletRequest=true&dt.action=process&dt.provider=PortletWindowProcessChannel&dt.windowProvider.targetPortletChannel=JSPTabContainer/sEventsCalendar/Event&dt.containerName=JSPTabContainer/sEventsCalendar&dt.windowProvider.currentChannelMode=VIEW&dt.window.portletAction=RENDER&contentCode=essoe211011
